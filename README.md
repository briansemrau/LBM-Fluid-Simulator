# Lattice Boltzmann Fluid Simulator

An interactive simulation using the Lattice Boltzmann method in Javascript.

[Play with the water simulation here (broken but still pretty)](https://briansemrau.github.io/fluidsim/water)
[Play with the gas simulation here](https://briansemrau.github.io/fluidsim/gas)<br>

### Future Plans

- [x] Basic LBM simulation with boundaries
- [x] Improve performance
- [ ] Implement free surface for water simulation (Thürey, Chapter 4)
- [ ] Add gravity with user interactivity
- [ ] Implement moving obstacle boundary conditions (Thürey, Chapter 5)
- [ ] Explore adaptive topology for large scale simulations (Maybe Thürey, Chapter 7)
